So I know that covid was a hoax personally! It is the common cold. Common cold is caused by either coronavirus or rhinovirus. The 1st time a new virus enters an unprotected population (smallpox vs Native Americans) is has a devastating effect until natural immunity builds up. Weaker viruses appear stronger the first time around. A balance is eventually struck between humanity & nature. Now that most people have caught it 3-4 times & the virus has mutated 6-7 times it's getting less virulent each time. Also, you should NEVER attempt to vaccinate DURING a pandemic because you cannot keep up with the spread of the disease & the disease will always out mutate your vaccines, plus you could create a superbug. We messed up BAD & got lucky. We should have just let everyone catch it & then vaccinated 5 years later if we wanted to attempt to minimize losses - but only keep the vaccine to high risk people. So what does this mean for the data? It means that the data can very well be REAL. It's just raw data. However, depending on what news source you see it in or how they use it in CONTEXT it could be used to say ""vaccines are safe & effective!"" Or it could be used to prove that they aren't because many people still get the virus without it. Context matters. Personally, only the J&J vaccine was developed using verified safe means but that's the ONLY one the FDA denied. I was unable to get that vaccine - so I decided not to get ANY. I've still remained free of COVID :) haha! I would NOT trust any of the guinea pig vaccines for various reasons that are too long to go into here. It's all about risk/reward. Why take ANYTHING to protect yourself against something that has a .05% chance of killing you? It's the Lipitor factor. Lipitor has a 1/300 chance to work on you but a 1/15 chance of giving you side effects. Why take Lipitor? We are a drug addicted nation. I feel bad for everyone with that vaccine inside their bodies & them calling it ""misinformation"" when their kids have autism. We find out every day that what was yesterday's ""misinformation"" is tommorrow's news. (MK Ultra, Tuskeekee Experiments, Hunter Biden's Laptop, Trump stealing the election, covid made in a lab, the CIA killing JFK, 9/11 being an inside job, etc). These are all verified facts today. So a chart is only a chart in a vacuum. It's used for good or evil depending on what's attached to that chart. Hopefully THIS chart is attached to an article saying DONT GET VACCINES!! THEY ARENT TESTED!! COVID isn't a dangerous virus! (Exception to rule: immunocompromised/elderly - then take ONE shot).  Hope you learned something today! ",852.498,3,7,4,4,4,2,"As I've said before I've seen firsthand working in the medical industry how information can be twisted. For example, a Dr see's a Patient. Dx that pt. Says they have an infection (lets say strep throat), but that pt already also has AIDS. A medical coder takes the paperwork & codes it. ICD-10 has strict coding rules & you MUST add AIDS 0.42 ICD-9 or B20 ICD-10, & depending if AIDS was the PRIMARY REASON for the infection or not it depends on WHERE you put the B20... does it go first? Or second? Now you get a new coder who puts B20 then dx the ICD-10 code for strep underneath it.. your stats there will say that this strep was CAUSED BY THE AIDS!! Got it? When the Dr CLEARLY stated that someone coughed on them & they GOT the strep like you & I would have - because the pt said their whole family has strep - so it SHOULD have been coded strep THEN B20/HIV.

I worked in an office where these mistakes happened A LOT. So much I sued... & won a judgement. I cannot disclose how much or who etc per the terms. However it's MUCH MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK. These people were giving services to a LARGE AREA. Your stats don't mean anything & I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. I know more about the medical system than 99% of people. 

So no... these charts are jokes. I work on hundreds of thousands of cases & I take my own notes & keep my own stats & they don't match. I know how many people have ""gastritis"" or ""MRSA"" etc.",545.789,1,"I said everything I needed to say in other comments. Natural immunity is best. Vaccine immunity cannot be passed down generationally. If you want your kids to survive in the future against the manufactured superbugs - (remember the ONLY people immune to AIDS naturally are the direct descendants of the survivors of the Black Death), then make sure you get them sick a lot! Play in dirt! NO VACCINES! Only the strong survive!!

They were correct of course as the Civil War would prove. Reconstruction did not fix the problem as we allowed 50% of the people who never wanted to be American's to remain here with their divisive symbols & anti-governments. The 1960s saw a reversal of polarity in Dems/GOP over state's rights & civil rights but they kicked the can down the road until Reagan decided to blow the whole thing up - leading to us here today with Reaganomics & the destruction not only the middle class, but the Federal budget, & class warfare, overwhelmed by ever increasing polarization of a broken & corrupt 2 party system that desperately needs a 3rd, 4th, & 5th party & the 7 ways our vote is diluted to be broken down step by step. However too many are unaware of even 1 of these examples, let alone all & getting everyone to agree enough on anything is impossible so only another war will fix it. They have done well.
