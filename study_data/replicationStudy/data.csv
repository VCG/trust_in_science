Study Title: Data Communication and Trust in Science

Supported By: University of Toronto, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard University

 

WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?


 
 Whether or not you take part is up to you.
 
 
 You can choose not to take part.
 
 
 You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
 
 
 Your decision will not be held against you.
 

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

The purpose of our study is to explore how people process information in the age of misinformation. Particularly, we are investigating aspects of trust in visualizations. 
 

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

Any person who is at least 18 years of age may participate in this research study.
 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?

We expect about 1000 people will be in this research study.
 

WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?

We will be shown different visualizations and you will be asked questions regarding the visualization, your understanding, impressions, etc. . We expect this research study to take around 15 minutes. At the end of the survey, you will be given the choice to to opt-in to a follow up study on the topic. This is completely optional and will not interfere with the current study.  
 

WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY? 

You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization.
 

WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 

Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.
 

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. 

 

Data Sharing: De-identified data from this study will be shared among the UMass Amherst and University of Toronto research teams, as well as the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. 
 

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Carolina Nobre, at cnobre@cs.toronto.edu. 

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?

You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.

So I know that covid was a hoax personally! It is the common cold. Common cold is caused by either coronavirus or rhinovirus. The 1st time a new virus enters an unprotected population (smallpox vs Native Americans) is has a devastating effect until natural immunity builds up. Weaker viruses appear stronger the first time around. A balance is eventually struck between humanity & nature. Now that most people have caught it 3-4 times & the virus has mutated 6-7 times it's getting less virulent each time. Also, you should NEVER attempt to vaccinate DURING a pandemic because you cannot keep up with the spread of the disease & the disease will always out mutate your vaccines, plus you could create a superbug. We messed up BAD & got lucky. We should have just let everyone catch it & then vaccinated 5 years later if we wanted to attempt to minimize losses - but only keep the vaccine to high risk people. So what does this mean for the data? It means that the data can very well be REAL. It's just raw data. However, depending on what news source you see it in or how they use it in CONTEXT it could be used to say ""vaccines are safe & effective!"" Or it could be used to prove that they aren't because many people still get the virus without it. Context matters. Personally, only the J&J vaccine was developed using verified safe means but that's the ONLY one the FDA denied. I was unable to get that vaccine - so I decided not to get ANY. I've still remained free of COVID :) haha! I would NOT trust any of the guinea pig vaccines for various reasons that are too long to go into here. It's all about risk/reward. Why take ANYTHING to protect yourself against something that has a .05% chance of killing you? It's the Lipitor factor. Lipitor has a 1/300 chance to work on you but a 1/15 chance of giving you side effects. Why take Lipitor? We are a drug addicted nation. I feel bad for everyone with that vaccine inside their bodies & them calling it ""misinformation"" when their kids have autism. We find out every day that what was yesterday's ""misinformation"" is tommorrow's news. (MK Ultra, Tuskeekee Experiments, Hunter Biden's Laptop, Trump stealing the election, covid made in a lab, the CIA killing JFK, 9/11 being an inside job, etc). These are all verified facts today. So a chart is only a chart in a vacuum. It's used for good or evil depending on what's attached to that chart. Hopefully THIS chart is attached to an article saying DONT GET VACCINES!! THEY ARENT TESTED!! COVID isn't a dangerous virus! (Exception to rule: immunocompromised/elderly - then take ONE shot).  Hope you learned something today! ",31.976,849.766,852.498,11,3,7,4,4,4,2,"As I've said before I've seen firsthand working in the medical industry how information can be twisted. For example, a Dr see's a Patient. Dx that pt. Says they have an infection (lets say strep throat), but that pt already also has AIDS. A medical coder takes the paperwork & codes it. ICD-10 has strict coding rules & you MUST add AIDS 0.42 ICD-9 or B20 ICD-10, & depending if AIDS was the PRIMARY REASON for the infection or not it depends on WHERE you put the B20... does it go first? Or second? Now you get a new coder who puts B20 then dx the ICD-10 code for strep underneath it.. your stats there will say that this strep was CAUSED BY THE AIDS!! Got it? When the Dr CLEARLY stated that someone coughed on them & they GOT the strep like you & I would have - because the pt said their whole family has strep - so it SHOULD have been coded strep THEN B20/HIV.

I worked in an office where these mistakes happened A LOT. So much I sued... & won a judgement. I cannot disclose how much or who etc per the terms. However it's MUCH MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK. These people were giving services to a LARGE AREA. Your stats don't mean anything & I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. I know more about the medical system than 99% of people. 

So no... these charts are jokes. I work on hundreds of thousands of cases & I take my own notes & keep my own stats & they don't match.

They were correct of course as the Civil War would prove. Reconstruction did not fix the problem as we allowed 50% of the people who never wanted to be American's to remain here with their divisive symbols & anti-governments. The 1960s saw a reversal of polarity in Dems/GOP over state's rights & civil rights but they kicked the can down the road until Reagan decided to blow the whole thing up - leading to us here today with Reaganomics & the destruction not only the middle class, but the Federal budget, & class warfare, overwhelmed by ever increasing polarization of a broken & corrupt 2 party system that desperately needs a 3rd, 4th, & 5th party & the 7 ways our vote is diluted to be broken down step by step.
