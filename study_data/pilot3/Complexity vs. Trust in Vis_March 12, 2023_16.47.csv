Study Title: Data Communication and Trust in Science

Supported By: University of Toronto, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard University

 

WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?


 
 Whether or not you take part is up to you.
 
 
 You can choose not to take part.
 
 
 You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
 
 
 Your decision will not be held against you.
 

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

The purpose of our study is to explore how people process information in the age of misinformation. Particularly, we are investigating aspects of trust in visualizations. 
 

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

Any person who is at least 18 years of age may participate in this research study.
 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?

We expect about 1000 people will be in this research study.
 

WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?

We will be shown different visualizations and you will be asked questions regarding the visualization, your understanding, impressions, etc. . We expect this research study to take around 15 minutes. At the end of the survey, you will be given the choice to to opt-in to a follow up study on the topic. This is completely optional and will not interfere with the current study.  
 

WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY? 

You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization.
 

WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 

Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.
 

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. 

 

Data Sharing: De-identified data from this study will be shared among the UMass Amherst and University of Toronto research teams, as well as the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. 
 

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Carolina Nobre, at cnobre@cs.toronto.edu. 

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?

You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.
