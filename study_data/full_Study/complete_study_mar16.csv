Study Title: Data Communication and Trust in Science

Supported By: University of Toronto, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard University

 

WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?


 
 Whether or not you take part is up to you.
 
 
 You can choose not to take part.
 
 
 You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
 
 
 Your decision will not be held against you.
 

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

The purpose of our study is to explore how people process information in the age of misinformation. Particularly, we are investigating aspects of trust in visualizations. 
 

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

Any person who is at least 18 years of age may participate in this research study.
 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?

We expect about 1000 people will be in this research study.
 

WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?

We will be shown different visualizations and you will be asked questions regarding the visualization, your understanding, impressions, etc. . We expect this research study to take around 15 minutes. At the end of the survey, you will be given the choice to to opt-in to a follow up study on the topic. This is completely optional and will not interfere with the current study.  
 

WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY? 

You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization.
 

WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 

Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.
 

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. 

 

Data Sharing: De-identified data from this study will be shared among the UMass Amherst and University of Toronto research teams, as well as the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. 
 

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Carolina Nobre, at cnobre@cs.toronto.edu. 

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?

You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.

the scrolling function that seems as off as this one does you know when you drag the cursor across the line and the figures are reversed i don't know what to believe it's hard for me to answer this reasonably. if everything lined up i would probably say agree to all the above seems like it's accurate seems like it's meaningful seems like if i was a farmer or somebody at delta agriculture it would be very useful information. but i sure wouldn't want to be buying a lot of treatments for one or the other if the data doesn't match up every time i look at it or every way i look at it perhaps i should say.,13.227,20.254,81.018,7,5,5,2,7,7,2,for one thing the system is difficult to use and for a second thing when you scroll over the timeline the figures are reversed. they report them just opposite i can't remember exactly which way it was but the whichever way it was the figures were reversed the blue ones were the opposite as the brown ones on the scroll in other words it was giving you the exact opposite data when you scrolled across it then what the chart itself read. so you never know with researchers are you guys doing this just to throw us off and see if somebody has a screwy operating system we'll say we trust it or is it just a mistake. if everything was consistent i would say i trust the data but since the design is flawed i don't know what's going on.,4.025,4.025,118.213,1,5,in the comments i made earlier i should have said mouse over instead of scroll but that's what i meant the mouse over reversed the figures the numbers were if i remember right were the insects were in blue and wrong and the fungus was in brown and wrong for the mouse over that was in the system i looked at now if i was a control group then that's why i don't trust the data i mean i guess i should say experimental group that i don't trust the data. these last two charts where everything was consistent yes i would trust the
