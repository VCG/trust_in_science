would be very useful information. but i sure wouldn't want to be buying a lot of treatments for one or the other if the data doesn't match up every time i look at it or every way i look at it perhaps i should say.,81.018,6,6,3,2,2,3,for one thing the system is difficult to use and for a second thing when you scroll over the timeline the figures are reversed. they report them just opposite i can't remember exactly which way it was but the whichever way it was the figures were reversed the blue ones were the opposite as the brown ones on the scroll in other words it was giving you the exact opposite data when you scrolled across it then what the chart itself read. so you never know with researchers are you guys doing this just to throw us off and see if somebody has a screwy operating system we'll say we trust it or is it just a mistake. if everything was consistent i would say i trust the data but since the design is flawed i don't know what's going on.,118.213,5,in the comments i made earlier i should have said mouse over instead of scroll but that's what i meant the mouse over reversed the figures the numbers were if i remember right were the insects were in blue and wrong and the fungus was in brown and wrong for the mouse over that was in the system i looked at now if i was a control group then that's why i don't trust the data i mean i guess i should say experimental group that i don't trust the data. these last two charts where everything was consistent yes i would trust the data.,70.90100000000001,2,7,3,4,1,5,6,26.23,4,6,6,6,6,4,8,8,Thanks for letting me
